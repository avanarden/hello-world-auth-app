# Growing as a Software Engineer

I often encounter talented Individual Contributors (ICs) who are passionate about their craft but may not be interested in leadership roles. How does "People are promoted into the role they're already performing" apply here?

## Hone Your Engineering Skills

- **Master Your Core Skills**: Deepen your understanding of the programming languages and technologies you use. Understand underlying principles and best practices.
- **Work on Complex Problems**: Seek out challenging projects that push you out of your comfort zone. Solving complex problems will develop your analytical and problem-solving skills, essential for a senior role.
- **Focus on Software Fundamentals**: This is key to becoming an adaptable software engineer. Understand the software patterns behind the frameworks you are using and what makes software scalable.

## Be a Great Team Member

What is just as essential as any technical capabilities is being a good team member and being easy to work with.

- **Collaborate and Engage Cross-Functionally**: Work with peers and non-engineers alike. Share your knowledge and learn from others too.
- **Maintain Focus on Your Team's Goals**: Demonstrate understanding of the objectives and understand how your work contributes to the bigger picture, and raise blocking issues early.
- **Participate in a Positive Team Culture**: Set an example, and feel comfortable contributing.

## Develop Leadership Skills at Every Level

Improving skills such as relationship building, communication and emotional intelligence is crucial, not only for aspiring managers. By developing these abilities, you become a more effective member of a high-performing team. In the most senior technical roles you'll use them to influence others positively. Your engineering expertise starts to have a multiplier effect on the whole team.

The goal of a leader is to help your team achieve the best outcomes sustainably. Have this goal in mind and take steps toward it; no formal title is needed.

- **Mentor Your Peers**: Share your knowledge, support them through challenges, and celebrate their victories.
- **Set the Standard for Your Team's Culture**: Be proactive about addressing issues, share your learnings openly, and help teammates feel more comfortable contributing.
- **Question How Work Aligns with Goals**: Demonstrate understanding of the objectives and how they connect to the bigger picture.
