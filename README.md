# Hello World Full Stack App

A simple full stack application with React frontend and Node.js backend.

## Setup

1. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash

This will start both the backend server (on port 5000) and the frontend development server (on port 3000).

## Manual Setup

npm run dev
```

### Frontend

npm start
```

The app will display "Hello World" fetched from the backend API.
