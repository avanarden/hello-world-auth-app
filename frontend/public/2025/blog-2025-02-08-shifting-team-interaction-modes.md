# Shifting Team Interaction Modes

I was thinking about an enterprise client I worked with several years ago. I managed a medium-sized product group working across two mobile platforms and a small BFF (Backend for Frontend). The BFF aggregated legacy APIs and modernized services.

The default interaction mode between my team and downstream service teams was X as a Service (XaaS). This worked well as long as we implemented features similar to the existing web platform, but when our goal became to solve a new customer problem, XaaS no longer served us.

## Why the Existing Model Broke Down

- We needed fundamental concepts to be represented in new data models.
- We were in discovery mode and needed to figure out what new operations had to be performed downstream.
- Those teams had priorities and roadmaps not aligned with our goals and were unlikely to build what we needed in our timeframe.

## Shifting to Collaboration

The new operational strategy was clear: shift from XaaS to Collaboration. Both teams needed to actively iterate over the same problem together.

Tactically there are always challenges. Here are some of the aspects we, as a management team, focused on:

- **Assess Timeline Impacts**: Understand the impacts to timelines of value delivery.
- **Realign Priorities**: Set expectations with all stakeholders about what is changing and why.
- **Build Cooperative Relationships**: Develop relationships with management counterparts in the collaborating team.
- **Minimize Stakeholder Impacts**: Work with leadership peers to reduce disruption.
- **Facilitate New Relationships**: Connect key team members such as engineers most likely to interact and solve key problems.
- **Prepare the Teams**: Communicate new priorities, clarify the reasons for the change in collaboration, and manage resistance to this new approach.
- **Define the Mechanics**: Facilitate discussions on how stand-ups and other rituals will function during collaboration.

At that time we did not have the ubiquitous language of interaction modes. With the introduction of concepts like those in Team Topologies, this story is much easier to tell now.
