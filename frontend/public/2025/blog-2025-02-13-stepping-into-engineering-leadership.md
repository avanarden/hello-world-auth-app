# Stepping Into Engineering Leadership

When I coach software engineers wanting to move into leadership roles I will often say "People are promoted into the role they're already performing." What I mean by this is: embody the skills and activities of your next desired role today, not tomorrow.

This applies to a people leadership position like an Engineering Manager, and a technical leadership role such as Principal Engineer. Now's the time to start laying the groundwork.

## Lead Without a Title

The goal of a leader is to help your team achieve the best outcomes sustainably. Have this goal in mind and take steps toward it; no formal title is needed.

Here are a few ways to make an impact:

- **Mentor Your Peers**: Share your knowledge, support them through challenges, and celebrate their victories.
- **Engage Cross-Functionally**: Work with non-engineers, like product managers and designers, to broaden your perspective. Learn how you can support their work.
- **Set the Standard for Your Team's Culture**: Model behavior. Be proactive about addressing issues, share your learnings openly, and help teammates feel more comfortable contributing.
- **Maintain Focus on Your Team's Goals**: Demonstrate understanding of the objectives. Question how work aligns with these goals.

## Hone Your Leadership Skills

It's all about practice and honing leadership-specific skills such as relationship building, effective feedback, communication, empathy, and emotional intelligence. They'll serve you well on your leadership journey.
