# Where Do High Performers Thrive

The cultural underpinning of high performing teams is essential for success, it outweighs the details of specific rituals and processes. In my experience, these are the characteristics of a high performance culture.

## 1. Learning and Improvement

- **Culture of Feedback**: Feedback drives improvement; team members and leaders learn to be comfortable giving and receiving feedback.
- **Psychological Safety, Inclusion, and Diversity of Ideas**: Varied solutions and interpretations of the problem space are freely voiced, and team members feel safe to do so.
- **Growth Mindset**: The team values continuous learning and growth, embracing improvements over perfection and discouraging heroics.

## 2. Empowerment

- **Leadership as a Skill**: Every team member, at their own level, adopts a leadership mindset to sustainably drive the team towards optimal outcomes.
- **Team Autonomy and Cross-disciplinary Support**: A collaborative spirit across disciplines exists, and together, the team determines the course of action to solve the problem at hand.
- **Seeking Help**: Asking for help is encouraged; team outcomes are placed above individual outcomes. The strength in vulnerability is well understood, and people feel comfortable doing it.

## 3. Problem-Aligned Teams

- **Clear Vision and Strategy**: The team has a roadmap; they know where they are trying to go. Senior leaders and managers dedicate time and focus to ensure that clarity.
- **Emphasis on Problem-Solving**: Teams with a strong mental model of the problem focus on crafting solutions aligned with company goals, rather than solely completing tasks.
- **Proactive Questioning**: Teams drive their own alignment with the overall objectives; they seek clarity and are comfortable discussing where they see misalignment.

I work directly with software leaders, line managers, and teams to help achieve immediate objectives and shift towards a high performing culture.
