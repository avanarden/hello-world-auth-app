# High Performing Teams: Beyond Frameworks

I recently replied to a question on a post about measuring engineering teams, asking if there is a better methodology, with scrum's perceived problems. I don't think scrum (or any framework) is good or bad.

## Characteristics of a High-Performing Team Optimizing for Fast Flow

- **Deliver Value Quickly**: Deliver meaningful value in short cycles. This includes not just business value but also maintaining quality and enhancing the development experience.
- **Deliver Quality**: Balance fast delivery with the right level of engineering quality, ensuring sustainability, but also considering the timing of business opportunity, when appropriate.
- **Learn and Adapt**: Each iteration brings new learnings that the team uses to improve the next cycle's value delivery.
- **Responsive to Change**: Being agile (in the true sense of the word) means adjusting to change effectively and efficiently.
- **Create Small as Possible Stories**: Work items with clear value. One of the largest contributors to all of the above.
- **Effective Collaboration**: Team members discuss problems regularly, increasing the chances of finding more of the gaps and uncovering ignorance of the problem space together.

## What Success Looks Like

- **Sustainable Delivery**: The team can consistently deliver value to the business while maintaining team morale and productivity.
- **Alignment with Business Goals**: The team's efforts are connected to broader business objectives.
- **Minimal Gap in Knowledge of the Problem Space**: Solutions adequately match the problem they are trying to solve.
- **Technical Excellence**: Quick delivery does not mean poor quality. Once the team knows more about the problem space from a previous iteration, they have the opportunity to refactor and address necessary tradeoffs made.

Whether it's Scrum, Kanban, or even short waterfall cycles, the "best" framework is the one that enables your team to embody these principles. As a manager, your role is to guide your team towards these ideals. It's less about the framework, but more of the pattern of behavior it develops in the team.
